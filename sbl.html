 <p>Hi, I'm Malachai, though I've gone by many nicknames, I'm 14. I'm generally interested in the arts like drawing, writing, acting, coding if you can consider that an art, but frankly I'm not all that good at any of those. I sleep (& basically live) in a repurposed closet like that kid from the Loud House, & despite only having two sisters instead of 11 my house is rather loud. I do have two cats though & those are nice. They're named Jade & Collin, Jade is beyond cute & Collin is a little dumb & also very cute.</p>
