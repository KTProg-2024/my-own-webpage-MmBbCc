      <h3>short bio lol</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Malachai, though I've gone by many nicknames, I'm 14 & I go to Keefe Tech & I've gotten my second choice of shop, programming. I usually have health/physed for A block, then learning strageties for B, C is history, D is biology, E is math, & F is ELA.I'm generally interested in the arts like drawing, writing, acting, coding if you can consider that an art, but frankly I'm not all that good at any of those. I sleep (& basically live) in a repurposed closet like that kid in the loud house, & despite only having two sisters instead of 11 my house is rather loud. I do have two cats though & those are nice. They're named Jade & Collin, Jade is beyond cute & Collin is a little dumb & also very cute.</p>
      <h3>fav webpages</h3>
      <p>My three favorite webpages would probably be <a href=https://wikipedia.org>Wikipedia</a> for its easy, accessible, & vast amount of information, <a href=https://youtube.com>Youtube</a> for its endless entertainment & education (especially since I learn better through videos some of the time), & finally <a href=https://mariowiki.com> the Mario Wiki</a> for being Wikipedia focused around a subject I happen to take interest in.</p>
