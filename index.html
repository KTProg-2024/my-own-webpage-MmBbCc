      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <font size=4>I am Malachai Brooks Ciardi of Framingham.</font size><img alt="I don't have selfies available on my computer lol"><br>
      <h3>short bio lol</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Malachai, though I've gone by many nicknames, I'm 14 & I go to Keefe Tech & I've gotten my second choice of shop, programming. I usually have health/physed for A block, then learning strageties for B, C is history, D is biology, E is math, & F is ELA.I'm generally interested in the arts like drawing, writing, acting, coding if you can consider that an art, but frankly I'm not all that good at any of those. I sleep (& basically live) in a repurposed closet like that kid in the loud house, & despite only having two sisters instead of 11 my house is rather loud. I do have two cats though & those are nice. They're named Jade & Collin, Jade is beyond cute & Collin is a little dumb & also very cute.</p>
      <h3>fav webpages</h3>
      <p>My three favorite webpages would probably be <a href=https://wikipedia.org>Wikipedia</a> for its easy, accessible, & vast amount of information, <a href=https://youtube.com>Youtube</a> for its endless entertainment & education (especially since I learn better through videos some of the time), & finally <a href=https://mariowiki.com> the Mario Wiki</a> for being Wikipedia focused around a subject I happen to take interest in.</p>
      <h2>april 5<sup>th</sup></h2>
      <p>I was born on April 5<sup>th</sup> of 2006, & so every April 5th I celebrate my birthday, generally with a cake & whatnot, & often times on a date near that I might go to Chuck E. Cheese or something & invite several of my friends but I'm getting a bit old for that so I'm not sure what I'm gonna do this year.</p>
      <p>Among many notable things that have happened on the 95<sup>th</sup>/96<sup>th</sup> day of the Gregorian Calendar throughout history include the second Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919), the election of E.M.S. Namboodiripad as the first chief minister of Kerala establishing communist dominance in the state (1957), & the opening of the longest bridge in the world (the Akashi Kaiky≈ç) (1998).</p>
