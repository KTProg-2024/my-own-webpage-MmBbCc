<p>My three favorite webpages would probably be <a href=https://wikipedia.org>Wikipedia</a> for its easy, accessible, & vast amount of information, <a href=https://youtube.com>Youtube</a> for its endless entertainment & education (especially since I learn better through videos some of the time), & finally <a href=https://mariowiki.com> the Mario Wiki</a> for being Wikipedia focused around a subject I happen to take interest in.</p>
