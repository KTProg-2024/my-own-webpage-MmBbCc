<p>I was born on April 5<sup>th</sup> of 2006, & so every April 5th I celebrate my birthday, generally with a cake & whatnot, & often times on a date near that I might go to Chuck E. Cheese or something & invite several of my friends but I'm getting a bit old for that so I'm not sure what I'm gonna do this year.</p>
      <p>Among many notable things that have happened on the 95<sup>th</sup>/96<sup>th</sup> day of the Gregorian Calendar throughout history include the second Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919), the election of E.M.S. Namboodiripad as the first chief minister of Kerala establishing communist dominance in the state (1957), & the opening of the longest bridge in the world (the Akashi Kaiky≈ç) (1998).</p>
